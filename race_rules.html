    <h3>RULES</h3>
    <p>This series will be governed by the rules here.</p>
    <p>The Sailing Instructions during a race may also change other racing rules.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="notice">
    <h3>NOTICE TO COMPETITORS</h3>
    <p>A skippers meeting will take place prior to any race, unless informed otherwise.</p>
    <p>This whole thing is a for fun and a way to increase participation.  If you quote one of the rules in here as part of a petition you will automatically lose your argument. </p>

    <h3>CHANGES TO SAILING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <p>Changes may be made orally by the Race Committee prior to any race, while on the water.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="scoring">
    <h3>SCORING</h3>
    <p><strong>Points</strong> will be awarded to boats based on their finishing position in the race. The formula for calculating points will be as follows: a boat will receive twice the value in points as the number of boats it beats. For example, if there are 5 boats racing and a boat finishes first, it will receive 8 points (4 boats beaten, multiplied by 2).</p>
    <p><strong>Participation Point:</strong> Every boat that enters the race (touches the water) will be awarded 1 point. This encourages participation and recognizes the effort of all boats taking part in the series.</p>
    <p><strong>New Participant Point:</strong> Each new person participating in a series for the first time will earn 1 extra point for their boat. This applies regardless of the boat's finishing position. For example, if a boat has 3 people on board and 1 of them is new to the series, the boat will receive 1 additional point.</p>
    <p><strong>Individual Scores:</strong> Each person on board a boat will have an individual score that is not tied to a specific boat. Every person aboard a boat will receive the same score/points at the completion of a race.</p>
    <p><strong>Picture Bonus:</strong> A boat will receive 1 point for sharing 5 or more decent pictures of OTHER boats. These pictures must be unique and not repeated multiple times. Selfies will not count for this bonus.</p>
    <p><strong>Completion Bonus:</strong> Completion Bonus: Every boat that successfully completes the course, regardless of its finishing position, will be awarded 1 point.</p>
